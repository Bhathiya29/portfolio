## Overview

This project involved the development of a distributed quiz platform using a microservices architecture. The primary objective was to create a modular system with clear service separation for quiz management and question handling, allowing for improved scalability and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Modular Microservices**: Built individual services for quizzes and questions using Spring Boot.
- **RESTful APIs**: Designed and implemented over 10 API endpoints for quiz creation, question assignment, and scoring logic.
- **API Gateway & Feign Client**: Integrated an API Gateway and used Feign Client for smooth inter-service communication and load balancing.
- **Database Integration**: Utilized PostgreSQL for structured storage of quizzes, questions, and user responses.
- **Resilient Architecture**: Enabled independent scaling and deployment of services, improving system fault tolerance.

## Technologies Used

- **Java, Spring Boot**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **REST API**
- **Feign Client, API Gateway**
- **Microservices Architecture**

## Challenges and Learnings

Orchestrating microservices and maintaining their stateful interactions was the primary challenge. Setting up proper API routing and error handling across services required careful planning. Understanding circuit breakers and load balancing also deepened my experience in distributed system design.

## Outcome

The application served as a proof of concept for scalable educational platforms, successfully separating domain concerns and improving modularity. The microservice model allowed flexible upgrades and future feature expansion.
