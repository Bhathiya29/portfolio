## Overview

Cogni Assess is a year-long research and development project aimed at addressing limitations in MOOC platforms through automated aspect-based review analysis. By integrating deep learning and natural language processing, this system extracts meaningful insights from massive user feedback datasets.

## Key Features

- **Aspect Extraction Algorithm**: Designed and built a scalable deep learning algorithm to process 100,000+ reviews for opinion mining.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Used Python (Flask) and JavaScript (React) to create a user-friendly web application showcasing review results.
- **Fake Review Detection**: Integrated an SVM model to filter out fake reviews, improving result accuracy.
- **Independent Scaling**: Architected the system with independent scaling for front-end and back-end.
- **RESTful API**: Employed a clean REST API design to maintain separation between business logic and UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Python, Flask**
- **JavaScript, React**
- **REST API, SVM**
- **MySQL, Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)**
- **Project Management (Agile/Scrum)**

## Challenges and Learnings

The key challenge was building an intelligent NLP pipeline capable of processing large datasets efficiently while handling edge cases such as sarcastic language or mixed sentiment. This required careful model training, data preprocessing, and RESTful service design.

## Outcome

Cogni Assess significantly reduced time and effort in analyzing MOOC feedback and demonstrated how AI can enhance educational platforms at scale.
