## Overview

PIXL is a feature-rich social media web app built using PHP (CodeIgniter 3), JavaScript (Backbone.js), and MySQL. The app supports key social media features like posting, commenting, and following users while using a RESTful API architecture for scalable and maintainable development.

## Key Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Structured the entire platform using MVC to separate logic, presentation, and data layers.
- **Dynamic Front-End**: Used Backbone.js to build responsive UI components with real-time updates.
- **Core Social Features**: Implemented user registration, login, post creation, commenting, and liking systems.
- **RESTful API Layer**: Developed 20+ API endpoints to serve mobile/web clients.
- **Optimized Database**: Designed and indexed a MySQL schema capable of handling high user activity and data volume.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP (CodeIgniter 3)**
- **JavaScript, Backbone.js**
- **MySQL**
- **REST API**
- **MVC Pattern**

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was building a responsive, real-time UI using Backbone.js while keeping the server-side logic maintainable. Implementing a fully RESTful interface and ensuring clean decoupling of layers improved performance and debugging workflows.

## Outcome

PIXL is a robust and scalable social platform that demonstrates full-stack development capabilities with a focus on clean code, RESTful architecture, and user-centric feature design.
