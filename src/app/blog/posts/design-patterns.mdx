## Overview

Design patterns are time-tested solutions to common software design problems. They promote best practices like code reusability, separation of concerns, and scalability. Whether you're writing front-end code or architecting back-end systems, knowing these patterns will level up your software design skills.

---

## 1. Singleton Pattern

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **Use Case**: Database connections, config managers
- **Benefit**: Controlled resource usage

---

## 2. Factory Pattern

Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Use Case**: UI component rendering, document parsing
- **Benefit**: Flexible object creation

---

## 3. Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.

- **Use Case**: Event systems, UI frameworks, Pub/Sub systems
- **Benefit**: Decoupled communication

---

## 4. Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable. The algorithm can be selected at runtime.

- **Use Case**: Sorting strategies, payment methods
- **Benefit**: Cleaner logic and runtime flexibility

---

## 5. Decorator Pattern

Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without modifying their structure.

- **Use Case**: UI enhancements, logging, authentication
- **Benefit**: Open/Closed Principle compliance

---

## 6. Adapter Pattern

Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. Acts like a translator.

- **Use Case**: Legacy code integration, external APIs
- **Benefit**: Seamless integration without refactoring

---

## 7. Command Pattern

Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.

- **Use Case**: Undo/redo systems, task queues
- **Benefit**: Decouples sender and receiver of requests

---

## 8. Proxy Pattern

Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- **Use Case**: Lazy loading, access control, caching
- **Benefit**: Performance optimization and security

---

## 9. Builder Pattern

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same process to create different representations.

- **Use Case**: Object initialization with many optional fields (e.g., HTTP requests)
- **Benefit**: Code readability and flexibility

---

## 10. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Lets you pass a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it on.

- **Use Case**: Middleware, validation pipelines
- **Benefit**: Decouples request sender from receivers

## Final Thoughts

These design patterns are foundational to writing clean, modular, and maintainable code. While they’re not silver bullets, they offer powerful mental models for solving recurring problems in software development.
