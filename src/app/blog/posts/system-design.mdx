## Overview

System design is at the heart of building scalable, high-performance software systems. Whether you're preparing for tech interviews or architecting real-world platforms, understanding these core concepts is essential.

This article breaks down the **Top 10 System Design Concepts** every engineer should understand, with practical examples and terminology.

---

## 1. Load Balancing

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.

- Types: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash
- Tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer

---

## 2. Caching

Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce latency and load on databases.

- Types: In-memory (Redis, Memcached), CDN caching
- Techniques: Write-through, Write-around, Write-back

---

## 3. Database Sharding

Splits a large database into smaller, faster, and more manageable parts called shards.

- Horizontal vs. Vertical sharding
- Key challenge: cross-shard joins and rebalancing

---

## 4. Indexing

Improves read performance of databases by maintaining additional data structures for quick lookups.

- Types: B-Tree, Hash, Composite indexes
- Trade-off: Faster reads, slower writes and more storage

---

## 5. Asynchronous Processing

Decouples components using message queues or background jobs to handle long-running tasks.

- Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Celery
- Benefits: Resilience, fault tolerance, scalability

---

## 6. Rate Limiting

Controls the rate of incoming requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage.

- Strategies: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket
- Use Cases: API protection, DoS mitigation

---

## 7. Consistency Models

Defines how data changes are visible across distributed systems.

- Strong Consistency vs. Eventual Consistency
- CAP Theorem trade-offs: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance

---

## 8. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A globally distributed network of servers that delivers static content from locations closer to the user.

- Improves load speed and reduces server load
- Providers: Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront

---

## 9. Redundancy and Replication

Creates multiple instances of critical components to prevent single points of failure.

- Active-Active vs. Active-Passive replication
- Helps with failover and disaster recovery

---

## 10. Monitoring and Observability

Ensures system health and quick incident response through logs, metrics, and alerts.

- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- Key concepts: SLOs, SLIs, SLAs

---

## Final Thoughts

Mastering system design is less about memorizing buzzwords and more about applying the right patterns at the right scale
